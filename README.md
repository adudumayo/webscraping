Welcome to my **book-scraping** repo, where I teach myself the fundamentals of web scraping

## **What’s This About?**  
I’m scraping **[Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/)**, a perfectly legal website made for web scraping practice. No actual books were harmed in the making of this project.  

### **Tech Stack:**  
- **Python + BeautifulSoup**
- **Requests**
- **Go (Coming Soon!)**  

## **Why Am I Doing This?**  
- I want to learn web scraping. 
- Manually browsing is old news, I let my code do the work.  

## **⚠️ Disclaimer**  
- This is just for fun and learning, not for actual book piracy.  
- No books were physically scraped, I promise.  

## **Next Steps**  
- Write the scraper I want in **Go** because… why not?  
- What do you think?
